    "## Virtual Study Buddy App â€“ Matching Logic Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the core matching algorithms for the Virtual Study Buddy App, which connects students based on shared academic interests, availability, and learning preferences. The goal is to foster meaningful peer-to-peer support through tailored match suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We offer two matching modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Default Mode: Tutorâ€“Learner Matching\n",
    "In this model, students are assigned a role based on their GPA:\n",
    "- **Tutors**: Students with a GPA â‰¥ 3.5  \n",
    "- **Learners**: Students with a GPA < 3.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Learners are automatically paired with tutors who:\n",
    "- Specialize in overlapping subjects\n",
    "- Share at least two study days with 60+ minutes of time overlap\n",
    "- Have a compatible study style\n",
    "\n",
    "This mode generates the top 3 tutor recommendations per learner using a standardized scoring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Custom Mode: Preference-Based Matching\n",
    "This mode allows learners to set their own matching priorities via selectable preferences, such as:\n",
    "- Shared subjects  \n",
    "- Matching availability (days and/or time)  \n",
    "- Study style compatibility  \n",
    "- Similar GPA goals  \n",
    "- Personality alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can emphasize what's most important to them, and the algorithm scores and returns the best tutor matches accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "All results are formatted for easy integration into a front-end application or exportable reports. All matching results in this notebook are structured as flat pandas DataFrames or lists of dictionaries, with clearly labeled columns such as student_id, match_id, subject_overlap, and total_score. This format ensures compatibility with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Export tools like .to_csv() or .to_json() for reporting or analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Front-end applications via simple API responses (e.g., converting to JSON for use in JavaScript or Flask-based interfaces)\n"

    "### Time Overlap Utility Function\n",

    "**Parameters:**\n",

    "- `start2`, `end2`: Second student's availability window.\n",
    "- `min_overlap_minutes`: Minimum required overlap in minutes (default is 30).\n",

    "## Default Mode Matching Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "This section defines the automatic matching logic used by the Virtual Study Buddy App to pair learners with compatible tutors. This mode does not require user input and is ideal for quickly generating tutor recommendations for all learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matching Criteria:**\n",
    "1. Role-Based Filtering\n",
    "Only students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher are considered tutors. The default logic matches learners (below 3.5 GPA) exclusively with these tutors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subject Overlap**\n",
    "Matches are only considered if the learner and tutor share at least one subject of interest â€” ensuring the tutor is qualified to help in the learnerâ€™s target area.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Availability (Days & Time)**\n",
    "The learner and tutor must share at least 2 study days, with a minimum of 60 minutes of overlapping UTC availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Study Style Compatibility**\n",
    "Learners are more likely to be paired with tutors who share a similar study style, increasing the chance of a productive match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "Each learner receives a list of their top 3 tutor matches based on a scoring system that considers subject relevance, shared time, and compatibility traits. This approach offers a structured yet automated way to improve academic performance through peer support."

    "## Custom Matching Based on User Preferences \n",
    "This section introduces a more targeted matching logic tailored to the peer-tutoring model. Students are divided into learners (GPA below 3.5) and tutors (GPA 3.5 or above). Learners can be matched with available tutors based on selected preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Only learners can request matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only tutors (students with a GPA â‰¥ 3.5) are eligible as match partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matching is fully customizable, based on selected criteria like availability, study style, GPA goals, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Functions:**\n",
    "- `custom_match(user_id, preferences)`:\n",
    "For a given learner, this function ranks tutor matches by score based on criteria such as:\n",
    "    - Overlapping subjects\n",
    "    - Shared availability (days + time)\n",
    "    - Matching study styles\n",
    "    - GPA alignment\n",
    "    - Personality compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "-`generate_all_custom_matches(preferences)`:\n",
    "Applies `custom_match` across the entire dataset to return top-ranked tutor matches for each learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "Matching preferences are passed in as a dictionary of booleans ({ 'subjects': True, 'days': False, ... }). The match score increases with each matching trait, creating a list of tutor recommendations per learner. This logic is ready to connect to a frontend interface where students can select what matters most to them (via checkboxes).\n",
